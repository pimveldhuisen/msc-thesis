\label{chp:introduction}
Many of us enjoy unrestricted access to the internet in all it's glory without being snooped on. At the same time however, a large portion of the world can not.\cite{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country}. One of the features of the Tribler software is to provide anonymous routing, in order to enable privacy and prevent censorship. This feature is currently usable in real life applications, but the performance is often lacking in comparison to open traffic. One of the root causes of the performance degradation is the increased bandwidth requirements. Since the traffic is routed through multiple hops, the total bandwidth requirements are proportional to the number of hops.
