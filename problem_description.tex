\chapter{Problem Description}
An essential problem in functioning of open distributed system is the allocation of reputation and thrust to the different nodes. Internet based systems that allow users to join without verification suffer from various types of users that do not behave properly, i.e. the do not further the common goals of the system. The users may be faulty, lazy, persueing their own goals, or actively trying to undermine the system. For the network to function in spite of these bad users, in most cases it needs some way to distnguish between 'good' and 'bad' users. 

 Since information is by definition distributed over multiple nodes in the network, no single node is guaranteed to have a complete overview of the information in the network. Protocols to aquire the global state exist, but these may be relatively costly\cite{]. An \emph{open} distributed network, where anonymous nodes may freely join over the internet, provides additional challenges, since not all nodes may be loyal to network; instead of furthering the overall goal of the network, they may strife to achieve their own individual goals. While some of such open systems have shown to be effective \cite{}, they have trouble mantaining consistent records of their users \cite{} in a dsitributed manner, and often use centralized mechanisms to acheive this \cite{}.\\
